Hi [PROSPECT_NAME],

Hope you are doing very well. Following up on our conversation about the potential participation of [Prospect Company] in the Blockchain Summit LATAM 2025.

I understand that schedules can get busy, but we were very enthusiastic about coordinating a call to share the value proposition in depth, especially considering the institutional and strategic profile we are consolidating.

I'll take this opportunity to leave you with some key updates since our last exchange:

‚úÖ **Key Updates Since We Last Spoke:**
*   **Confirmed:** The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), alongside the central banks of Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, and Chile.
*   **New Speaker:** Juan Carlos Reyes, president of El Salvador's CNAD, has joined as a speaker.
*   **Official Media Partner:** Negocios TV is confirmed (global leader in YouTube views among financial media in Feb 2025).
*   **Regional Activations:** Roadshows are being organized in Bogot√°, Medell√≠n, Lima, Santiago, San Jos√©, and Buenos Aires, in partnership with local fintech and blockchain chambers.

üèÜ **Blockchain & Fintech LATAM Awards:**
Organized with our regional chamber allies under multilateral MoUs, we are featuring award categories aligned with the profile of the [client type/industry, e.g., 'exchange' or 'payments' sector]:
*   [Mention 2-3 specific award categories relevant to their business from the full list, e.g., Best CEX, Best Web3 Education Initiative, Best Fintech-Web3 Integration].

üëâ If you are still interested, you can book a time directly here: [YOUR_BOOKING_LINK]
Or, if you prefer, I'd be happy to use your scheduling tool.

I would be delighted to resume the conversation when you consider it appropriate. I'm convinced that [Prospect Company] can play a leading role in this edition of the Summit.

Best regards,
[YOUR_NAME]`,

        <><strong>Email Resistance Strategy:</strong> Two-tier approach: (1) FIRST try value preview method - give specific confirmations (BIS, Central Banks, BlackRock) then justify email process. (2) If still resistant, use logical fallback about efficiency and self-selection.</>,
        <><strong>Value Preview Method:</strong> 'Of course! We have confirmed BIS, 4 Central Banks, BlackRock, JP Morgan... for organization and follow-up workflow purposes, I prefer email.' Shows transparency while maintaining professional standards.</>,
        <><strong>Diplomatic Justification:</strong> 'For organization and follow-up workflow purposes' sounds professional and systematic, not preferential. It positions email as a business standard, not personal preference.</>,
        <><strong>Avoid Dry Responses:</strong> Never just say 'It's too much info for this channel.' Always give value preview first, then justify the email process. Dry responses lose qualified prospects.</>,
        <><strong>Efficiency Language:</strong> 'Most economical/time-efficient' frames the email process as beneficial for them, not just you.</>

Hi [PROSPECT_NAME],

I'm writing one last time before I close the file on my end. I‚Äôm convinced there's a powerful opportunity here and wanted to share one final, concrete thought.

[Insert your deep research here. Example: "I was reading your company's Q4 report where your CEO, [CEO_NAME], emphasized the strategic priority of expanding into new regulated markets. This aligns perfectly with what we are building."]

---

üí° **An Idea to Spark a Conversation...**

What if we built a high-profile panel specifically around [Prospect Company]'s interests?

For example, I just confirmed a powerhouse panel for our regulatory track featuring:
*   **Carlos Salinas** (Head of Digital Assets, MoraBanc Andorra)
*   **Mar√≠a del Sagrario Navarro** (LegalTech Expert, University of Castilla-La Mancha)
*   **Dr. Steffen H√§rting** (Senior Executive, Crypto Asset Markets at Deloitte)

They will be discussing "Regulatory entry requirements for the provision of crypto-asset services," with perspectives on:
*   Institutional frameworks and licensing regimes
*   Gaps and gray areas in MiCA
*   DeFi platforms and regulatory blind spots
*   Practical implementation from the banking sector

**The angle is: let's co-create a high-impact panel around a topic you're passionate about. You bring the vision, and I'll bring the high-level partners to make it happen.**

---

This is the level of conversation we're curating. Discussions with other key players in the [prospect's industry] sector are already advancing.

Is this a priority for you right now? If so, my calendar is open for a brief, direct conversation.

Best regards,

[YOUR_NAME]`;
