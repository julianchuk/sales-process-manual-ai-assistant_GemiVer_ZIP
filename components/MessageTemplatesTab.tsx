We're hosting an event in Medellín, Colombia focused on regulators and central banks.\n\nWe have confirmed Central Banks of Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, and Chile, with possible participation from Central Banks of Germany, Guatemala, and Dominican Republic. Additionally, we have major institutional players like BlackRock, JP Morgan Colombia, Bancolombia, and Banco Popular, among others.\n\nWould you be interested in learning more details about the sponsorship opportunities?\n\nBest regards,\nJulián Uribe`
